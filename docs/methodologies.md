# Development methodologies

## Domain-driven design (DDD)

A development approach where developers and stakeholders together model the business domain, aiming at understanding it, to easier develop and maintain a software solution.

## Behavior-driven development (BDD)

The software is documented and designed around behavior and not just requirements.

That means creating behavior specifications that can be automated in order to verify behavior.

## Test-driven development (TDD)

The idea of making testing a part of the development routine by creating unit tests to test behavior.

A common method when employing TDD is Red-Green-Refactor. Meaning that you create a failing tests with code stubs. After you have implemented the logic the test should pass - become green. Finally you refactor the code. This is repeated through the process.

Writing and testing behavior outside in.
